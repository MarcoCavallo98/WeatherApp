# WeatherApp
This is a simple weather app, developed for training my skills about C# WPF.

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching informations about weather. You can add and remove your favourite locations anche check the weather.

This app uses an SQLite DB for keeping your favourite locations.

This code is completely open, so use it whatever you want :)
